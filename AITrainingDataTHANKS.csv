I had saved up my points in order to get practical items for the classroom such as a new electric pencil sharpener, or music player.

7/20/2022,,,,,1,"I have never had so many problems as I have had this past school year. I did a classroom campaign to raise money for books for my students. When I go back and look at every order I placed, it says the total was one thing, but I ended up paying a few dollars over that. I would never do that unless the original total had told me that's what it was. I received a handful of emails throughout the school year telling me I owed money for orders, when I paid straight away with the money in my classroom funds. This is ridiculous. I hate that I don't even want to use this website anymore because the kids love when they get free books from me. I have done this the last four years. But, the hassle everything has been this year is not worth it.",Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise

For example, I just searched ""Harry Potter"" on both the book club site and on Scholastic.com and got 8 results from the club site and 52 from Scholastic.com. It is frustrating seeing books available on one site but not another, or the same book available for different prices on different sites - Scholastic is one company, correct?

8/2/2022,,,,,4,"I am satisfied overall with Scholastic's book selection and pricing, but I wish all Scholastic book titles were available across all Scholastic sites (Book Clubs/Book Fairs/Scholastic.com) and were all the same price/discounts/bundles. For example, I just searched ""Harry Potter"" on both the book club site and on Scholastic.com and got 8 results from the club site and 52 from Scholastic.com. It is frustrating seeing books available on one site but not another, or the same book available for different prices on different sites - Scholastic is one company, correct?

In the past I have asked 10 people via Facebook usually  to donate $25.00 each and that use to buy every kid in my class a book each month of the school year.,Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise

Its sad because I would be able to buy more books on a regular basis if they were cheaper.

I did find them in a series bundle purchase.  But I didn't want to buy the bundle because I already had many items within that bundle.

I work in a small district and I have few kids that even order anymore, so getting to the 25.00 is hard. What if I had a student who can only afford a small amount and they were ordering all the books they could in the $1, $2, or $5 section?

While browsing, I saw a book called ""David Gets in Trouble"" that showed a child on the cover sitting in a corner.  The 1950s called and they would like their degrading treatment of children back.  Additionally, I saw you are selling the ""How Do Dinosaurs..."" series which also normalizes emotionally aggressive relationships between parents and children.  Families have problems, yes.  Please do not normalize parental mistreatment of children and CONDITIONAL (rather than unconditional) love.  Please sell books that depict healthy methods of parents guiding their children morally and ethically.  Children being mistreated by their parents don't always realize that what their parents are doing is not healthy.  Normalizing harsh parenting through literature does not help.  It can take years for children to realize that their parents mistreated them and they should not repeat the same patterns",Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise

One of my parents sent me an email asking about her daughter's order and why she keeps getting emails from Scholastic about it.  I had no idea the parent had even submitted an order.    Secondly,  I think  Scholastic should set teacher accounts to a ""holding"" position  at the end of each school year. (no parent can place an order).  The teacher, at the start of the school year, or whenever he/she chooses, ""opens"" her account to her class for ordering.   The teacher then can check the account more regularly knowing that parents may be placing orders.    These are some suggestions I think would be helpful.

It was submitted after the due date however, no teacher is going to turn away a student that wants to order books.    The late order was for one item that costs $15.00. I was told that I couldn't add the item to previous order.  I understand that, but I was really disappointed when told that the shipping charge couldn't be waived in this case.       I don't believe the parent should have to pay more, and I certainly don't want to pay out of my pocket.

10/5/2022,,,,,4,"Last year it took a few google searches to figure out the difference between ""book fair"" and ""book club"".  ""Book club"" sounded like a subscription and ""book fair"" sounded like the thing we do when our children bring home a flyer.  The notes at the top and bottom of the flyer were really helpful for finding the right website.  I assume ""book fair"" is for the times when scholastic shows up onsite, and yet an online ordering option exists then, too.  I like both options because the take-home flyer results in many more ordered books and the on-site book fair gives kids an opportunity to practice working with cash.  I am also pleased with Scholastic's prices, and I love taking advantage of the free-book-with order deal.  I end up ordering more than I would have each time my child brings home a flyer.  The absolute best part of Scholastic is the free books given to kids and schools as part of the fund-raising process.  Our school needs more books in Spanish for their library.",Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise

At one point I entered an item number from my child's flyer in the search bar but a different book came up. Also, I clicked on a category, ""Feelings and emotions"" and did not see an item  that clearly should have been in that category (the ""Big Feelings Pack).  The way the items were displayed seemed clumsy and I had to click through multiple pages of items to review. I guess I'm comparing you guys to Amazon, where I do a lot of online shopping, and obviously they have a very slick site with all the bells and whistles.

I need to know how to manually choose how many and which types of catalogs to receive each month. Is that possible? Or will it always be this overdone auto order?

I was told that it was up to me to tell parents to put the child's full name in the field.  Which we do.   We can not make them enter anything.  YOU, on the other hand, can.  You can make a field required on check out.  Or you could also give me the name of the person who paid for the books.  As the person  who is taking the order, it's your responsibility to either collect the correct information needed.  I was very disappointed in Scholastic with this last order.  Your customer ""service"" just kept telling me it was my responsibility to tell parents to enter the child's full name.  That's not helpful.

What an absolutely atrocious experience on both android and iPhone.     Try adding money to your kids account. Account.scholastic would seem like a logical place... It's my account where I'd add my kids. But no. I have to add an ewallet for a FAIR for my kids. Why?  There is literally no connection between the fair and the account page. Why?    And book clubs?

I had only one student hand me a check for a $5 joke book even though most parents pay online. I was going to be charged $6 shipping. I called and asked if that could be waived due to my red apple status. I have been ordering from scholastic every month for 27 years.

You clearly prioritize some cultures over others, with an emphasis on skin color, since ""black"" is one of your cultures. I'm trying to not fault you since you probably have no more reasoning skills than the current trends of our society to favor certain skin colors and cultures, but it seems very obvious to me that favoring these things is repeating the mistakes of the past where there were popular skin colors that got unfair advantages.  Why would the lesson not be that all skin colors are equal and all cultures worth learning about rather than favoring the popular ones? I'm disappointed to see a company that has a hand in educating children jump on this harmful bandwagon. If you can't reason your way through this one, I start to wonder about your intentions and agendas and I want to do less business with you.

It would be fantastic if a feature could be added that would remember all of the books previously purchased and alert the user - across all linked kids/teachers - that the book had already been purchased.

The other part that was upsetting is the fact that yes you now have one book for 2.00,  two books for 4.00 and all the rest are 6.00 and higher. I have a class filled with English Language Learners whose parents can not afford to pay that much for books for their child.

1/10/2023,,,,,4,"I love buying books for my son on this site. He gets so excited when they come in to school. My only issues are that, even with the grouping, it is not always easy to find the type of books he likes without clicking on every one to read the blurb. For example, he loves funny books, but it is difficult to sort through the selection to find those. The groupings do not always show all the possible selections. Also, could you offer the holiday books in an earlier flyer? By the time I order the books, and they come in to his teacher and get distributed, I usually receive the Christmas (Halloween, Easter, etc.) books in January. By then, he loses interest in a Christmas book, and by the next year, it might be too childish for him. However, overall, you have an excellent site.",Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise

1/10/2023,,,,,1,"Everything about Scholastic seems like a scam. There was a ""Book Fair"" at my child's school, and I was railroaded into giving him money in a ""virtual wallet,"" with which he bought an awful book (I hesitate to call any book ""awful,"" but this one was written by ""Ryan"" of ""Ryan's World,"" the YouTube unboxing kid, and it was insipid) and a toy. I didn't realize the money could even be used for toys. That was last year. This year, my kid was sick on the one day his class went to the book fair, so we had leftover money in the wallet. When I tried to use it on this website, I had to ship books to his school, which was impossible because his teacher is not listed. So I either forfeit my money (as I basically did last year) or ship the books to a teacher at his school I've never met, email everyone at the school that I do know, and hope we get the books. It's been a month, and I haven't seen the books I bought. Total. Scam.",Not Thanks/Praise,Not Thanks/Praise
